# VoiceMemoView

Use this package to display a voice record button (the microphone icon) and provide a place to keep the recording or dictated text.
You may choose the SpeechDictation object for dictation or the VoiceRecording module for recording to a URL.  VoiceMemoView uses observable objects to communicate changes to your SwiftUI views.
